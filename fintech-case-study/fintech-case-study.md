# FinTech Case Study - Aave

## Overview and Origin

* **Aave**, formerly **Ethlend**

* Aave was created in 2017, at the time it was aptly named Ethlend.

* The founder and CEO of Aave is a Finnish law-school graduate named Stani Kulechov, though the company is based in London with another office in Switzerland.

* Stani was studying law at the Helsinki university in 2015 when he got interested in the Ethereum network. Stani was intrigued by Ethereum and begun exploring how it could help to disrupt the traditional finance system.

* In 2017 Stani launched Ethlend the product, along with the LEND tokens in the form of an ICO to further fund the development of Ethlend.


## Business Activities:

* Aave is disrupting traditional finance by allowing users to earn interest on their crypto deposits and inversely, allows users to borrow against their crypto while paying relatively low interest rates. 

* Aave's target customer base is to take loan potential away from the big banks and other legacy financial systems, appealing to individuals already in the crypto space who would otherwise take these traditional routes. The AAVE token currently has 78,292 wallet addresses holding it at the time of writing. Marketsize of the customer base for the lending protocol is hard to find but one metric they do offer is total value locked (TVL). Aave's TVL currently sits at $18b USD. The protocol has seen an astronomical increase in TVL since its launch on the Ethereum mainnet in 2020, rising from $40m in April 2020 to where it currently sits now at almost $19b. That's a 47,500% increase in just over a year. To me this is a huge vote of confidence for the future of decentralised finance as a whole.
